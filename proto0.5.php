							<p><b>Planning</b><br>
							This was the true beginning of this project and the beginning of Simple Intelligence. Through a series of events we ended up partnering with Dr. Matt Taylor and Washington State University. It was decided that since we didn't have enough initial capital to invest in the project ourselves, we would go through the university to make the project possible. The university would eventually pay for the patent, then Simple Intelligence would arrange to license the product though them. After this was decided, work began.

							<p><b>Execution and Problem Solving</b><br>
								During this prototype we were given advice from a very wise professor not to spend all our time on one prototype. With that said, we decided to start with a cardboard prototype of what we wanted to build. We never intended it to fly, but purely to get our minds around the problem at hand and discover any possible unforeseen issues in our ideas. We discovered that we wanted to use a small undercarriage that would hold and transfer the battery in and out of the system. We would use a small motorized pushing system to push the batteries through the undercarriage of the copter and then out into a charging bay.

								Unfortunately we don't have the original picture of the cardboard product, but it looked something like the picture on the right.
