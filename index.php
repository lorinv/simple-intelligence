								<p> Someone once said that robotics is today, what computers were 30 years ago,
								 we agree. Computers have revolutionized the world in a way no one ever expected.
								 They changed the way we work, the way we learn, and the way we go about our lives.
								 We expect robotics to do the same and would like to be apart of it. 
								 Simple Intelligence is a growing group of engineers looking to better the world through
								 robotics. </p>
